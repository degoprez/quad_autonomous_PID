# quad_autonomous_PID
# Instructions
## Hector Quadcopter 
First, install the Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt ROS Packages:
`https://github.com/tu-darmstadt-ros-pkg`
The packages that will be used are:
```
hector_gazebo
hector_localization
hector_models
hector_quadrotor
hector_slam
```
Once the packages are installed, compile them using `catkin_make` 
If you recieve dependency problems, correct them as listed by the compiler.

## Add Octomap Functionality
First, you must install the Octomap library:
```
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-octomap ros-kinetic-octomap-mapping
rosdep install octomap_mapping
rosmake octomap_mapping
```
Next, navigate to your `src` directory. Then navigate to the following `hector_quadrotor/hector_quadrotor_demo/`. Add the following to the bottom of your CMakeLists.txt
```
## The following adds octomap capabilities
find_package(octomap REQUIRED)
include_directories(${OCTOMAP_INCLUDE_DIRS})
link_libraries(${OCTOMAP_LIBRARIES})
```
Then, in the same directory, add the following to the package.xml 
```
<!-- The following adds octomap capabilities-->
<build_depend>octomap</build_depend>
<run_depend>octomap</run_depend>
```
recompile using catkin_make in your root directory.

## Configuring the Octomap Functionality
Next, we have to configure the Octomap to work on our system. To edit the configuration file:
```
rosed octomap_server octomap_tracking_server.launch
```
If you are unable to save changes because of read only issues, then alter the file directly using `sudo`:
```
sudo vim /opt/ros/kinetic/share/octomap_server/launch/octomap_tracking_server.launch
```
Once the file is open, add the following changes from:
```
<param name="frame_id" type="string" value="map" />
...
<!--remap from="cloud_in" to="/rgbdslam/batch_clouds" /-->
```
to:
```
<param name="frame_id" type="string" value="world" />
...
<!--remap from="cloud_in" to="/camera/depth/points" /-->
```
## Launch the program
Finally, to launch the program first run the hector quadrotor demo world:
```
roslaunch hector_quadrotor_demo outdoor_flight_gazebo.launch
```
Next, run the Octomap server:
```
roslaunch octomap_server octomap_tracking_server.launch 
```
Lastly run our PID control system:
```
./follow_pid_drone.py
rosservice call /enable_motors "enable: true"
```
